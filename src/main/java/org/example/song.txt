EASY COME, EASY GO
All my friends are gone, I don’t blame them I guess I’d move on, do the same thing
So I wrote a song to be my lullaby Sing me to sleep at night
Open my third eye

I’m not gon’ lie to you I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch I’m not gon’ lie to you
This has been a hard year How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go Waiting on a miracle
Guess it’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go Turn it down and lay low It’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go

Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I’m running from demons of my past So I wrote a song to help me slow down Keep my mind straight, but it’s a bit late

I’m not gon’ lie to you I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch I’m not gon’ lie to you
This has been a hard year How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go Waiting on a miracle
Guess it’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go Turn it down and lay low It’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
