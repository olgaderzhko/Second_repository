EASY COME, EASY GO
All my friends are gone, I don’t blame them I guess I’d move on, do the same thing
So I wrote a song to be my lullaby Sing me to sleep at night
Open my third eye

I’m not gon’ lie to you I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch I’m not gon’ lie to you
This has been a hard year How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go Waiting on a miracle
Guess it’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go Turn it down and lay low It’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go

Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I’m running from demons of my past So I wrote a song to help me slow down Keep my mind straight, but it’s a bit late

I’m not gon’ lie to you I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch I’m not gon’ lie to you
This has been a hard year How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go Waiting on a miracle
Guess it’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go Turn it down and lay low It’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go

I just need to let it go
Waiting on a miracle
Guess it’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go Turn it down and lay low It’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go

Remember when you got sick, cancer of the bone Everyone in school while you’re sittin’ at home In your wheelchair of grief, find no relief
We were there for the ups and downs
And there for the constant rounds of chemo Yeah, you know that you were our hero You were there when I was a zero
And I swear I’ll makes things before the long night Swear I’ll make things right tomorrow
But as for tonight

I just need to let it go Waiting on a miracle
Guess it’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go Turn it down and lay low It’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go

I just need to let it go Waiting on a miracle
Guess it’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go Turn it down and lay low It’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go

I just need to let it go Waiting on a miracle
Guess it’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go Turn it down and lay low It’s just the way it goes Easy come, easy go
